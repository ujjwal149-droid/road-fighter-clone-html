# 🏎 Road Fighter Clone (HTML5 Canvas)

A retro-style arcade racing game built using **vanilla JavaScript** and the **HTML5 Canvas API**.

This project was created to explore core game development concepts in JavaScript — including state management, animation systems, collision detection, and frame-independent movement.

---

## 🎮 Features

- State-based architecture (Menu → Countdown → Running → Win / Game Over)
- Frame-independent movement using delta time
- Smooth acceleration & drag system
- Animated crash explosion (multi-frame)
- Fuel pickup system with sound effects
- Dynamic traffic spawning (enemies + fuel tankers)
- Speed, fuel, and level progress UI
- Finish line detection with win transition

## 🚀 Purpose

Built to explore and understand how arcade-style games work internally — focusing on structure and systems rather than polish.
